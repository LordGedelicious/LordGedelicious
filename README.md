### Hi there 👋
Hello, my name is Gede Prasidha Bhawarnawa
I live in Bogor, Indonesia.
I'm enrolled at Institut Teknologi Bandung's School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics
My hobbies are reading, playing games, discussing politics and trends, and most and foremost, coding duhhh.
I started my journey on coding with BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) or SNAP!, a drag-and-drop program intended to teach game development to beginners.
Then I worked my way up the ladder by learning Construct 2, HTML 5, Javascript, and CSS.
But anyways, texts only are boring, so here's a quick recap of me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing my coding skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development, and some front-end & back-end development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Yep, anything to jumpstart my career.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with basic coding :P. Yes I suck hard right now, and I need help.
